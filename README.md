# Github User

This is a basic web application that searches for Github users using the Github v3 API. It implements the following front end technologies:

* React 16.9.x
* Redux 4.0.x
* Saga 1.0.x

## Requirements to Run Locally

* [Node 10.x or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* NPM 6.x or greater

## Getting Started

1) `npm install` to install packages.
2) `npm start` to start application.
3) Open the browser to http://localhost:8080.

## Notes

* Basic functionality is in place, but the UI is not user friendly. Searches must be done with the knowledge of Github date/number search syntax.
* Styling is responsive but very basic.
* Robust error handling and user notifications are not yet implemented.
* Unit and integration test suites are basic and incomplete.
* End to end testing is not yet implemented.
