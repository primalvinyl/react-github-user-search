# Github User Test

## Getting Started

1) `npm install` to install packages.
2) `npm start` to start application.

## Notes

* This is a React-Redux-Saga TypeScript application.
* You'll find that there is still much development to do!
* Basic functionality is in place, but the UI is not user friendly. Searches must be done with the knowledge of Github date/number search syntax.
* Syling is responsive but very basic.
* Robust error handling and user notifications are not yet implemented.
* Unit and integration test suites are basic and incomplete.
* End to end testing is not yet implemented.
* I used a boilerplate (I made it, so it's architecture is a little loose and based entirely on personal preference).
* This was developed on a Windows machine and not tested in a Mac/Linux environment. In theory there should be no compatibility issues, but please let me now if there are.
